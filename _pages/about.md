Hi, I’m Whanhee! I’m a PhD student at the [University of
Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), working with [Prof. Anna
Fariha](https://afariha.github.io/) in the [Utah
DBLab](https://mod.cs.utah.edu/). My research focuses on building database
systems that provide data management interpretability and explainability. I am
particularly interested in data management systems and explainable AI.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Hanyang
University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/) and my M.S. in Computer Science from
Hanyang University under [Prof. Yong Suk Choi](http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/member).
During my studies, I worked in the [AI Lab](https://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/), where I
focused on natural language processing.
